                <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                    Oversight is one of the key functions of the Country Coordinating Mechanisms. According to Requirement 3 of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) guidelines for CCMs, each CCM must have an oversight plan and follow this plan. To implement its oversightplan, the CCC needs to have an oversight body in place.CCC established the Oversight Committee as a permanent CCC committee to perform this task.
                <br>
                <br>
                    The Oversight Committee is responsible for contributing to effective oversight of all Global Fund financed programs and related processes in Cambodia, in accordance with the functions delegated to it by the Cambodia Country Coordinating Committee for the Global Fund ("the CCC") as defined in the CCC Governance Manual and these Terms of Reference.The Committee assists the CCC to fulfill its Responsibility to hold Principal Recipients accountable for resources given to the country: "CCMs are required to put in place and maintain a transparent, documented process to ... overseas program implementation".

                            The potential for conflicts of interest in oversight committee members can be considerable because the CCC OC members may include Global Fund grant implementers. CCC conflict-of-interest mitigation policy provides clear procedures on identification, declaration, documentation, and management of conflicts of interest.
                            <br><br><br>
                            All Oversight Committee members must declare any conflict of interest that will or could arise in the course of undertaking their oversight duties. All will sign a declaration at the beginning of their service. In addition, whenever the situation arises, a member must immediately declare his or her conflict of interest. The member must recuse himself or herself from conflicted matters under discussion.
